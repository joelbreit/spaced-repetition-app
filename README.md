# Spaced Repetition App

This is a **React web app** using **Tailwind v4** for styling. It includes a few libraries that I often use, such as **Recharts** for charts and **Lucide** for icons. The template is set up with **Vite** for fast development and **JavaScript** for simplicity/compatibility. This app was bootstrapped based on [my template for React + Tailwind web applications](https://github.com/joelbreit/react-tailwind-template)
